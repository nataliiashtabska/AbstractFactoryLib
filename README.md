Abstract Factory Pattern  

This project implements the Abstract Factory Design Pattern in C#. It creates related objects like drinks (Juice, Soda) and packaging (Bottle, Can) without specifying their concrete classes.  
Factories ensure proper product pairing, and the solution is tested with both unit and mock tests for reliability.
